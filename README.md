# Travel Photo Album

### Purpose

This is a simple responsive image gallery to share your travel pictures.

### Future Work

1. Right now it's just static HTML with hardcoded columns for the images. I will convert this to React to make this process more dynamic.
1. Also, the images will be stored in some management system like S3 or Cloudinary.
1. Currently there is a tab control to switch the travel albums. I would like to use a map display instead.
